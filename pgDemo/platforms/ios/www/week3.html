              Hello Everyone,
              </p>
              <p>
              Here are my responses to the posted questions.
              </p>
              <p> 
             1. Based on App Annie’s website the top selling app category for the US, Japan and Great Britain is the game category. The next four categories education, entertainment, lifestyle and business were all within the top 5 in different spots in different countries. Apple users are paying and utilizing more lifestyle or fitness apps than Google users. The abnormalities to the research is that for iOS in the US, Pandora is one of the top grossing apps and in Great Britain Skype is one of the highest grossing apps.

              2. I would infer that gaming is hot throughout the world. It will probably be the most competitive category and most labor and cost intense due to the high level of competition of everyone trying to compete with one another. Users are very impatient and will jump to the next shinny thing that starts gaining traction. “Google Play has more downloads than the App Store but the App Store is generating 2.3x the app revenue of Google Play (Annie, 2013)”.

                3. Here are some findings regarding global bandwidth usage throughout the world; “Average smartphone usage grew 50 percent in 2013. The average amount of traffic per smartphone in 2013 was 529MB per month, up from 353 MB per month in 2012. The average smartphone will generate 2.7 GB of traffic per month by 2018, a 5-fold increase over the 2013 average of 529 MB per month. By 2018, aggregate smartphone traffic will be 11 times greater than it is today, with aCAGR of 63 percent (Cisco, 2014)”.

                4. Of course the “go for it all we have unlimited funds and resources” strategy would be to create a game that could be launched in each County on each platform to maximize downloads and the user base. A secondary strategy would be to pick a niche, stay out of the ultracompetitive categories and develop a strong product that would be priced fair and have numerous in app purchase capabilities.
