              Hello Everyone,
              </p>
              <p>
                Please note my answers below to the posted questions.
              </p>

                1.  When utilizing images such as the images from Instagram you could have the alt tag be a dynamic field so you could put the image title in it.  Associating form labels with each element.  Label and fieldset tags can help out with accessibility.
              </p>

                2.  Most of the screen readers provide text to speech and when a user touches a button it will read what the button title is and tell the user that it is a button.  This is a great feature to use within your app.  You can utilize this pattern in the same way.  Notifying a user they have touched a button and reading out loud the name of the button so the user understands what they are touching.

                3.  I really didn’t realize all of the accessibility features that the iPhone has.  The second device I selected was the Google Nexus 7 and it does not have anywhere close to the features that the iPhone provides.
              </p>
              <p>
                iPhone 5s – Support for vision, hearing, learning, physical and motor with numerous categories under each.  Some of the vision attributes are; voice over, zoom, invert colors, speak selection, speak audio text, larger type, bold text, increase contrast, reduce motion, and on off labels.  Under each selection there can be numerous options.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nexus 7 – Only has two categories Services and System.  Under services you can select talkback on or off.  Under system captions there are the following options; magnification gestures, large text, auto-rotate screen, speak passwords, accessibility shortcut, text to speech output and touch and hold delay.
              </p>

                4.  SayText is an iOS app that reads the text in an image out loud.  Designed for visually impaired users.  Color ID is an iOS color recognition app that will announce a color of an object by pointing the camera at that object.

                Respectfully,
              </p>
